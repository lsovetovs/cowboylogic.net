        <p>
          February 2014 – Present – T-Mobile Manager – Sr. Manager, Digital
          eXperience Team
        </p>

        <p>Primary Responsibilities:</p>
        <li>
          Direct, Lead, Manage, Mentor, and Inspire a diverse team of ~175
          developer, tester, project, product, program, and portfolio subject
          matter expert engineers in digital quality for web and app interfaces
          and internal tool innovation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Introduced, designed, developed, and initiated a CoE dedicated to
          making quality experiences for the external and internal customers a
          platform of innovation, continuous improvement, and re-tooler of
          process, and people to a norm of transformational game-changing
        </li>
        <li>
          Sourced, Built, and trained new senior testers and test leads in
          eCommerce while building an Osmosis Layer and tester pool to capture,
          nurture and retain brain trust for UAT, system, API, and automation
          testing projects and products in a CoE and continuous improvement team
          model. My tenure has been focused on Digital and TFB
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed and built an employee retooling program to inspire employees
          to update to constantly expanding technology and methodology. Built a
          roadmap to move employees on sunsetting career paths to inspired new
          paths including education, training, and self-driven individual
          Development Plans, (IDP)s, that harness the direction of the company
          and provide a symbiotic relationship with the company’s vision,
          mission, and values
        </li>
        <li>
          Integrated diverse, new resources with team veterans with the goal of
          maximizing cross-training, balancing workloads, and promoting the best
          resource skill sets to the direct benefit of the products, programs,
          and projects assigned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Redesigned the software release program and built a Quality Program
          Management team, empowered to process the work streams from intake to
          release, including a new reporting structure built on Power-BI
          dashboards on the front end and common development, test, and delivery
          tools on the back end that supported push-pull reporting for a perfect
          fit at each management and stakeholder level. This program
          consolidated the varied reporting channels into an online report
          platform designed for a common experience and allowing for a short
          summary email from reporters, using links to audience-controlled views
          of the reported data, from executive view to full drill down for
          granular detail when needed. This saved a lot of inbox space while
          providing a personal view of the detail each audience member needed
        </li>
        <li>
          Assumed responsibility for test devices, credit cards, and SIM
          onboarding and management. Improved the process with a simple, online
          checkout and inventory system, allowing for ease of use, but easily
          read inventory control. This consolidation and control saved several
          thousands of dollars in test device costs. The Device Management now
          includes an internal inventory and management system designed and
          implemented by my team. More internal tools in progress spawned from
          our CoE team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built and maintaining friendly and proactive relationships with
          associated teams, bringing together a partnership of organizations
          into a clean and productive system that spanned Agile scrums and
          Waterfall project paths. This resulted in a short meeting every week
          where front-line contributors from all organizations meet to keep
          communication channels open and work together on common issues,
          independent of the constant churn of organization changes at higher
          levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Joined as a charter member and became a leader in an Employee
          Satisfaction team to build relationships, track and document T-Mobile
          career management tools, provide a continuing stream of ideas,
          processes, and resources to the overall team, and assumed
